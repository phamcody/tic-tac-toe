# tic-tac-toe
The Odin Project // Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is being created after a one month vacation

This project was inspired by the tic-tac-toe game made by Google

RECAP:
I believe that most of the javascript I wrote could be organized better and I do not think I utilized factory functions and modules correctly. A lot of the code is redudant and can be improved. This is a project I would 100% go back to to add transitions and animations to make the game flow more smoothly.
